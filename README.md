CityX Crime Watch Application
This application provides a comprehensive platform for analyzing crime data in CityX. It includes features for crime prediction, PDF report processing, and interactive crime maps.

Features
Crime Prediction: Predict the category and severity of a crime based on its description.

PDF Report Processing: Upload and process police reports in PDF format to extract key information.

Interactive Crime Maps: Visualize crime data on interactive maps, categorized by crime type and severity.

Data Analysis: Explore crime data through various visualizations, including temporal patterns, geographic distribution, and resolution types.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

Installation
Option 1: Local Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cityx-crime-watch.git
cd cityx-crime-watch
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Pretrained Model:
Ensure you have the pretrained model inside app/static/. You can generate this by running model_training.py:

bash
Copy
python model_training.py
Run the Flask Application:

bash
Copy
python wsgi.py
This will start the Flask development server, and the application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Option 2: Docker Setup
If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

Build the Docker Image:
Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image:

bash
Copy
docker build -t cityx-crime-watch .
Run the Docker Container:
Once the image is built, run the container:

bash
Copy
docker run -p 5000:5000 cityx-crime-watch
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Dockerfile Explanation
The Dockerfile is used to containerize the CityX Crime Watch application. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

Dockerfile
Copy
# Use Python 3.11 as base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install torch==2.6.0+cpu --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV FLASK_APP=wsgi.py
ENV FLASK_ENV=production

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "wsgi:app"]
Explanation:
Base Image: The image is based on python:3.11-slim, a lightweight version of Python 3.11.

Working Directory: The working directory inside the container is set to /app.

Dependencies:

The requirements.txt file is copied into the container.

torch is installed separately because it requires a specific CPU version.

All other dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Application Code: The entire application code is copied into the container.

Environment Variables:

FLASK_APP=wsgi.py: Specifies the entry point for the Flask application.

FLASK_ENV=production: Sets the environment to production mode.

Expose Port: The container exposes port 5000, which is used by the Flask application.

Run Command: The application is started using gunicorn, a production-ready WSGI server.

File Structure
app/: Contains the main application code.

static/: Static files including CSS, JavaScript, and pretrained models.

templates/: HTML templates for the web interface.

wsgi.py: Entry point for running the Flask application.

model_training.py: Script to train and save the crime prediction model.

requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.

Dockerfile: Configuration for containerizing the application.

Dependencies
The application requires the following Python packages:

pandas>=1.3.5

numpy>=1.21.0

scikit-learn>=1.0.2

transformers>=4.18.0

folium>=0.12.1

matplotlib>=3.5.1

seaborn>=0.11.2

PyPDF2>=2.10.0

joblib>=1.1.0

flask>=2.0.1

gunicorn>=20.1.0

Werkzeug>=2.0.1

tqdm>=4.62.3

regex>=2022.1.18

requests>=2.27.1

pillow>=9.0.1

ipykernel

Additional Notes
Ensure that the pretrained model is placed in the app/static/ directory before running the application.

The application uses Flask for the web server and Folium for interactive maps.

The model_training.py script should be run to generate the necessary model files if they are not already present.

Troubleshooting
Missing Model Files: If you encounter errors related to missing model files, ensure that model_training.py has been executed and the model files are correctly placed in app/static/.

Dependency Issues: If you face issues with dependencies, ensure that all packages listed in requirements.txt are installed correctly.

Docker Issues: If the Docker container fails to start, check the logs using:

bash
Copy
docker logs <container-id>

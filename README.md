# CityX Crime Watch Application

This application provides a comprehensive platform for analyzing crime data in CityX. It includes features for crime prediction, PDF report processing, and interactive crime maps.

## Features

- **Crime Prediction**: Predict the category and severity of a crime based on its description.
- **PDF Report Processing**: Upload and process police reports in PDF format to extract key information.
- **Interactive Crime Maps**: Visualize crime data on interactive maps, categorized by crime type and severity.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore crime data through various visualizations, including temporal patterns, geographic distribution, and resolution types.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Installation

### Option 1: Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cityx-crime-watch.git
cd cityx-crime-watch
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Using The Pretrained Model**:
Ensure you have the pretrained model inside app/static/. You can use the already trained one (added to the repo at app/static/) or You can generate it by running model_training.py:
```bash
python model_training.py
```

5. **Run the Flask Application**:
```bash
python wsgi.py
```
This will start the Flask development server, and the application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

### Option 2: Docker Setup

If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:
#### Option A: Build Your Own Image
1. **Build the Docker Image**:
Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t cityx-crime-watch .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
Once the image is built, run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 cityx-crime-watch
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

#### Option B: Use the Pre-built Image
1. **Pull the Public Image:**:
Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image:
```bash
docker pull baraakh/cityx:latest
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
Once the image is built, run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 cityx-crime-watch
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

## Dockerfile Explanation

The Dockerfile is used to containerize the CityX Crime Watch application. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

```Dockerfile
# Use Python 3.11 as base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install torch==2.6.0+cpu --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV FLASK_APP=wsgi.py
ENV FLASK_ENV=production

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "wsgi:app"]
```

### Explanation:
- **Base Image**: The image is based on python:3.11-slim, a lightweight version of Python 3.11.
- **Working Directory**: The working directory inside the container is set to /app.
- **Dependencies**:
  - The requirements.txt file is copied into the container.
  - torch is installed separately because it requires a specific CPU version.
  - All other dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- **Application Code**: The entire application code is copied into the container.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - FLASK_APP=wsgi.py: Specifies the entry point for the Flask application.
  - FLASK_ENV=production: Sets the environment to production mode.
- **Expose Port**: The container exposes port 5000, which is used by the Flask application.
- **Run Command**: The application is started using gunicorn, a production-ready WSGI server.

## File Structure

- **app/**: Contains the main application code.
- **static/**: Static files including CSS,Data Analysis images and pretrained models.
- **templates/**: HTML templates for the web interface.
- **wsgi.py**: Entry point for running the Flask application.
- **model_training.py**: Script to train and save the crime prediction model.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies.
- **Dockerfile**: Configuration for containerizing the application.

## Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:
- folium==0.19.5
- ipykernel
- joblib==1.4.2
- matplotlib==3.10.0
- numpy==2.2.3
- pandas==2.2.3
- pillow==11.0.0
- PyPDF2==3.0.1
- regex==2024.11.6
- requests==2.32.3
- scikit-learn==1.6.1
- seaborn==0.13.2
- vtqdm==4.67.1
- transformers==4.49.0
- Werkzeug==3.1.3
- flask==3.1.0
- gunicorn==23.0.0
- torch==2.6.0+cpu

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the pretrained model is placed in the app/static/ directory before running the application.
- The application uses Flask for the web server and Folium for interactive maps.
- The model_training.py script should be run to generate the necessary model files if they are not already present.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Model Files**: If you encounter errors related to missing model files, ensure that model_training.py has been executed and the model files are correctly placed in app/static/.
- **Dependency Issues**: If you face issues with dependencies, ensure that all packages listed in requirements.txt are installed correctly.
- **Docker Issues**: If the Docker container fails to start, check the logs using:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```
